FONTLOG for NewGardiner

Basic Font Information

NewGardiner aims to stay close to the style of the font in Gardiner's Egyptian
Grammar and its supplements, but it is more uniform. It was explicitly
designed for use on a computer screen, and consequently the lines are thicker
than in some other hieroglyphic fonts.

It is available in two versions. In the first, the code points are as
prescribed by Unicode, from 0x13000 to 0x1342E (in the SMP).  In the second,
the code points were transposed to 0xE000 to 0xE42E (in the Private Use Area
of BMP).  This was in order to accommodate for legacy software that cannot
handle character codes of more than 2 bytes.
